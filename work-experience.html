									<h2>Amazon Robotics</h2>
									<h3>Robotics Deployment Engineer, Contract</h3>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ARLogo.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>Decreased production errors by 20% and a launched site ahead of schedule by 1.5 months by diligently managing multiple teams of third-party assemblers for the installation of stations and drives. Established Allen Bradley software for robotic safety systems and set up Cognex vision for station recognition. Analyzed, debugged, & ensured that all robotic environments met Amazon Roboticsâ€™ GD&T requirements. Originated solution for robotic drive awakening procedure that cut procedure time from 5 to 2 hours per floor.</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Glaukos</h2>
									<h3>Systems Engineer, Student</h3>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GlaukosLogo.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>Enhanced fatigue testing process for new product development by creating a periorbital simulator test fixture with strong repeatability and reducing the time needed to test the product. Developed a contact force system that can be moved into position, apply, & measure force using C++ to periorbital simulator. Conceived a system to collect data from the load cell using an ADC to an Arduino, and a DAQ system for captured data. Computed finite element analysis simulation on test fixture to validate structural stability of material and design choices. Design a simulated human periorbital bone and tissue structure with key anatomic features.</p>

									<h2>Philips Respironics</h2>
									<h3>R&D Controls Engineer, Intern</h3>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/PRLogo.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>Sole intern working independently on creating an automated test fixture for prototype ventilator on the Respironics team. Reduced test process time from four hours to thirty-minutes by enabling test procedures to be completed using a program with a simplified UI. Facilitated multiple design reviews soliciting feedback and offering insight into design process to meet requirements. Collaborated with test engineers to gage usability requirements ensuring compatibility of test fixture with current workflow. Developed code for automated actuator controller using LabVIEW graphical programming environment. Engaged in final product testing at Westpak performing vibration, shock, & drop tests, as well as clinician trials.</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>University of San Diego</h2>
									<h3>Undergraduate Researcher</h3>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/USDLogo.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>Enabled more student engagement with the topics of tension and compression and allowed for a greater understanding. Conceptualized learning aid that provides a physical representation of tension and compression in a truss system. Drafted components for learning aid in Solidworks and produced parts using Ultimaker 2+ 3D printers. Implemented learning aid in lower division engineering statics course and integrated with instructor lesson plan.</p>

									<h2>Senior Aerospace, Jet Products</h2>
									<h3>Manufacturing Engineer, Intern</h3>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SAJPLogo.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>Integrated tools into an organized ERP program that manages, tracks, and allows for accountability of tools. Coordinated with the manufacturing engineering department by improving and implementing a new workflow system. Strategically analyzed tool storage patterns and developed identification and serialization system for inventory. Modified past tool designs using Solidworks and PDM to aid in the production of engine mounting solutions. Exceeded project goals by completing one-year projected plan in three months.</p>
